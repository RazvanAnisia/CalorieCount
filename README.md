# CalorieCount
An app for finding out calories in food, and keeping track of daisy intake.

## Motivation
Because I track my calories daily using different mobile apps, and I become more confident with my React skills, I decided to put them to good use and create this proof of concept web app.

### What's it built with?
* React.js
* React Router
* FoodFacts Api

### What's next?
Stay tuned, backend integration with user profile will follow.
